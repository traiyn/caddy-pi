# caddy-pi
Your very own Raspberry Pi Caddy!

As an amateur golfer, there is no telling where some of my shots may end up. Pair that with a poor ability to trace my shots, I was inspired to create a "Caddy" to track my shot tracjectory and search the area for my ball.


## Future Roadmap
Below is a general order of feature development.

1. Ball shot tracing to give approximate starting search area.
2. Acute ball location search based on starting search area.
3. Attachment for push cart
4. Import golf course maps to add visual tracing and shot stats.
5. Attachment for remote controlled push carts
